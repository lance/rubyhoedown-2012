# RubyConf Brasil 2012 Demo

This is the demo application I used in my TorqueBox talk at RubyConf Brasil 2012.

The Rails app is in `ideabox/`, and has two branches of interest:
the `master` branch is the app at the start of the start of the demo,
and `complete` is the app at the end.

The Clojure app is in `tweet-grabber/`.
